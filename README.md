# otree_course_examples
## econ6053*
The repo contains two public goods game experiments which are the coding examples for the oTree part of Econ6053 ([Experimental Economics, University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/courses/modules/econ6053))
* ```econ6053_pgg```: endowment = 20; number of participants in a group= 3; factor = 1.2
* ```econ6053_pgg_treatments```: adding a new treatment **_factor = 2.4_** to ```econ6053_pgg```
##### _Notes_
* The codes for ```econ6053_pgg_treatments``` and ```econ6053_pgg``` are basically the same (differs only in a few lines of codes). Both apps are presented for the purpose of illustration in the lecture. 
* The codes are for the regular version of oTree. Please run ```pip3 install -U "otree<5"``` in the command line to install.
